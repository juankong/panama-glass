# **Tired of Corruption and Lack of Transparency in the Government?**

## **Do something about it.**

### **Meet the Experts. Share your Ideas. Be a Part of History in the Making.**

On February 22-25, world-renowned experts in finance and Blockchain technology will converge on Panama to brainstorm solutions for “modernizing and promoting transparency in Panama” in behind-the-scenes, closed-door meetings at the “Panama Glass Summit.” The decisions made in these meeting will provide a template for a path forward for Panama that will be presented to the public in the conference and in a whitepaper that can be used by government officials and influencers alike. It is truly history-in-the-making. 

At least 12 lucky students will be chosen among hundreds of entries for the privilege of being in the room working side-by-side with our experts in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

**Are YOU One of Those Students?** 

Submit a 500-600-word paper (translated into both English and Spanish) about: **“How I Think Technology Can Increase Transparency and Diminish Corruption in Panama?”**

•	In addition to a free ticket, winners will be IN THE ROOM having discussions with international leaders in technology to help solve these problems.

•	Student winners will be responsible for putting together a “whitepaper” on the results of the summit, which will be credited with their name and published.

•	Winners will also receive a prize in cryptocurrency.

To be clear, this is a contest and the winning students will receive an incredible experience worth much more than the effort.
